# Simplism
Decrapify websites, and adblock filter/blocklist with sole purpose: Minimalism.

_This list will be updated every so often with more filters._

Compatibility: I made this through ublock, but **it'll work on any adblock.** To add this blocklist simply enter this url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t3dium/Simplism/main/Simplism_Full.txt in the import filters area of your adblock, or if that doesnt work then copy and paste this files contents into "my filters" but you wouldnt get updates this way.

## Current supported and antibloated websites:
**Simplism Full:** Includes cookie notices/rickroll blocking, **Simplism:** minimal, just for website debloating

_I maintain and make this list, however for cookie blocking I rely on r4vi in his blocklists as it'll probably be more extensive. As for the anti-rickrolls, they are from rickrolldb (ricklist)_
